I did it, I finally found it. The final ingredient to the antidote,
and it wasn't even an exotic ingredient, in fact everyone probably keeps it in their houses. All I needed was a couple drops of Apple Juice. 
I actually came by this discovery on accident as I was eating my lunch at the lab table. 
Juice boxes are super convenient, but sometimes I simply cannot get the straw in without spilling a few drops.
Oh well, I guess it's not always a bad thing, now is it?
