~...<

Scruffles@
 ^
~Just kidding! Hello, welcome!<

Me@
 ^
~Oh, I was just about to arrest you for attempted kidnapping.<

Scruffles@
 ^
~My humor gets me in a lot of trouble,+
 ^
Everyone here on the island thinks I am some kind of crazy scientist.+
 ^
I mean I am hardly a scientist, just crazy!<

Me@
 ^
~...

Scruffles@
 ^
~Haha... there I go again.+
 ^
You see, I never get visitors so I get a little over the top sometimes.+
 ^
Anyway, what can I do for you Detective?<

Me@
 ^
~I need some  help with something.+
 ^
I've found some vials filled with liquids and notes talking about an antidote, to what hopefully is causing all these infections.+
 ^
I'm hoping that you might be able to help me figure out all the ingredients needed.<

 @
1^
~You give the ingredients to Scruffles<

Scruffles@
 ^
~Ohh-la-la! You brought a fun challenge for me?!+
 ^
Okay I think I can decipher what you still need.>



l - after looking at ingredients for a while#
Scruffles@
 ^
~I have come to the conclusion after I calibrated my results and taken away all of the anomalies and photosynthesized the ingredients you have given me….+
2^
Scruffles hands you your ingredients and a note+
 ^
I have written them down for you, and once you get all of them, come back and I can brew you up an antidote.<

Me@
 ^
~Thanks, see you soon, I guess.<

Scruffles@
 ^
~Alas, another one escapes my trap.<

Me@
 ^

2 - Conv after getting ingredient list before recieving all ingredients#
Scruffles@
 ^
You're back! And since you don't have all the ingredients yet, it must mean you came to just visit me.{<

~Do you like being alone?+
Do you ever leave?+
Yeah, let's talk?+
Leave>


3 - Alone#
Me@
 ^
~How is it, living alone on this isolated cliff... on an isolated island?<

Scruffles@
 ^
~Not bad, but only having your own thoughts to talk to causes some side effects.>

4 - Leave#
Me@
 ^
~Do you ever leave your house? How do you get your supplies and food?<

Scruffles@
 ^
~I used to get out, but since I learned how to create my own synthetic food there isn't really any need.>

5 - Story#
Me@
 ^
~Well, since I'm here, is there something you'd like to talk about?<

Scruffles@
 ^
~Actually, I had this really weird dream last night.+
 ^
... continue with story...>

6 - Leave#
Me@
 ^
~Hey, I actually have to be going, I have ingredients to collect and all.<

Scruffles@
 ^
~Oh... okay, guess I'll see you again later, right?<

Me@
 ^
~Right>
