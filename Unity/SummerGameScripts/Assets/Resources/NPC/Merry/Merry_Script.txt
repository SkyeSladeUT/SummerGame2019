Will you please help me find them?<

Try those two places. I'll sit here and think some more...<

Give Keys to Mayor#
~Thank you so much! Phew, I was worried. Last time I lost my keys I couldn't find them for days.<

Me@
 ^
~Days?<

Mayor Merryann@
 ^
~Heh heh... why don't you come inside? I can make some tea and show you around.+
 ^
It is haunted... But you're brave, won't you still come in?{<

No thank you>

4 - Inside House - before exploring#

Mayor Merryann@
 ^
~You know, with everything going on I think I am more safe with the ghost!{<

~It is very strange+
Why is it happening>

5 - very strange#
Me@
 ^
~It is very strange, people randomly turning into zombie-like creatures.<

Mayor Merryann@
 ^
~I have been elected mayor here for so long and I care so much about the island. I just want my people to be safe.>

6 - Why#
Me@
 ^
~Do you have any idea why this is happening?<

Mayor Merryann@
 ^
~You know this island seems so nice and pretty now, but we do have quite a dark past...+
 ^
I wonder if its karma coming back around to us.{<

~Dark past+
Continue Exploring>

7 - Dark past#
Me@
 ^
~What makes our history so dark?<

Mayor Merryann@
 ^
~I'm not good with details. There might be some information around the manor, why don't you take a look around!>

8 - Continue Exploring#
Me@
 ^
~I'm going to keep looking around. The longer I wait on this investigation the more people are hurt by the virus.<

Mayor Merryann@
 ^
~Of course, It's a shame what happened to all those people years ago... but we have such a wonderful life now.+
 ^
Please, detective, save my island and my people!{<

12 - Kym#
Me@
 ^
~Do you know about Kym being infected?<

Mayor Merryann@
 ^
~Yeah, what a shame, I hear she's still reading even though she's infected!+
 ^
I sure do hope Dr. Brad can figure out what is going on with them...>

13 - Kirk#
Me@
 ^
Have you heard about Kirk. He got infected almost the exact same time as Kym.<

Mayor Merryann@
 ^
~Poor Kirk, I know he's a simple boy but his intentions were always in the right place. I sure wonder how he got infected...>

14 - place suggestions#
Me@
 ^
~Do you have any suggestions as to where I should search?<

Mayor Merryann@
 ^
~I know this island really well, but the one place I never go to is the sewer. It stinks!+
 ^
I don't know what's there except Luther. I don't know how he stands to live there!>

15 - Leave#
Me@
 ^
~Well, I'm going to get going. There's more investigating to do.<
