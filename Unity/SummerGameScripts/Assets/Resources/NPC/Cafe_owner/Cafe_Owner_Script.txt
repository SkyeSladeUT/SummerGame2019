1 - Suspisions#
Me@
 ^
~Have you noticed or heard anything about what happened to Carl and who may have done it?<

Cafe Owner@
 ^
~I don't know much about what's been happening, but something that's always suspicious is Scruffles+
 ^
I haven't seen him around for a few months, probably stuck in his lighthouse trying to invent some new synthetic food.+
T^
Maybe he's been creating whatever infected Carl...+
N^
In fact, if I had to guess whose been behind it, it would be Scruffles.<

Me@
 ^
~Thanks, I'll look into it.>

2 - Places to investigate#
Me@
 ^
~Is there anywhere that I might be able to learn more about the history of the island?+
 ^
Perhaps there's someone who wishes for harm on the people of this island.<

Cafe Owner@
 ^
~If you want history, I'd go to the Mayor's mansion+
 ^
She's kept every scrap we've found on this island and has basically turned her house into a museum.+
 ^
Of course you might not want to go there... she claims her house is haunted. But I don't believe in that stuff.<

Me@
 ^
~Okay, I'll go talk to her. Hopefully I can find out something useful.>
