  itemDescription: I did it, I finally found it. The final ingredient to the antidote,
    and it wasn't even an exotic ingredient, in fact everyone probably keeps it in
    their houses. All I needed was a couple drops of Apple Juice.  I actually came
    by this discovery on accident as I was eating my lunch at the lab table.  Juice
    boxes are super convenient, but sometimes I simply cannot get the straw in without
    spilling a few drops. Oh well, I guess it's not always a bad thing, now is it?
